Uni assignment for Games Development module. A simple 3D game which based off a brief which I had to copy exactly as shown.

The uni games development module used a UCLan own game engine called "TL-Engine".

(Models wont have any textures, to run files add "bullet.jpg", "cube.jpg", "regular.jpg" & "super.jpg".)
